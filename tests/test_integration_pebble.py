"""
Integration test: full agent flow against a local Pebble ACME stub.

Prerequisites
-------------
  docker compose -f docker-compose.pebble.yml up -d

Pebble is configured with PEBBLE_VA_ALWAYS_VALID=1, so HTTP-01 and DNS-01
challenges are auto-approved without real DNS or port-80 access.  The agent
goes through every node: scanner → planner → account → order → challenge →
csr → finalize → download → storage → reporter.

Run with:
  uv run pytest tests/test_integration_pebble.py -v
